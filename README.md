## General info

Our project, "Sprout Scout", is an application that will help new or future gardeners understand what kinds of seeds and cuttings can be planted in their local
planting zone, as well as search for local public gardens for those who do not have planting space in their area. Our application will also display the day's current weather to plan your trip to your local garden accordingly.

<ins>Acceptance Criteria</ins>

```
GIVEN I am using the Sprout Scouts website to learn how to garden 
WHEN I open the Sprout Scouts website, 
THEN i see a a welcome modal that lightens the mood of anxious future gardeners.
WHEN I click an answer for the modal, 
THEN I am greeted by the Openweathermaps header, and google maps API to search for local gardens and local planting zone information.
WHEN I enter a zip code in the search bar,
THEN I am greeted with the results for current weather, zoning and planting information, as well as local gardens.
